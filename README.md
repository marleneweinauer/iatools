`styledtable` is an **R** package that makes it possible to export a `data.frame` as beautifully styled **Excel** and **LaTeX** table.

> Produce tables, which you want to look at.

Have a look at the [get started vignette](https://R-package.github.io/styledtable/articles/styledtable.html) to see `styledtable` in action.

Caution
-------

`styledtable` is currently under heavy development. Unfortunately, the current version is not fully stable.

If you want to use `styledtable`, we recommend installing the **last stable version**, which came under the **old package name** `styledTables`:

``` r
# Install last stable version from GitHub
devtools::install_github('R-package/styledTables', ref = "v0.1.0", build_opts = NULL)
```
=======
# iatools

iatools is an R package that provides some tools to test for suspicious interviewer behaviour for CATI (telephone) interviews. 

### Under Construction 

This repository is currently under construction. Soon you will find here an updated version with a vignette.
